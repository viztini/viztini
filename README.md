> "No matter where you go, everyone's connected." — Serial Experiments Lain

I'm a student currently taking **CS50 from Harvard**, learning the foundations of computer science, programming, and problem-solving.  
My interests lie in **systems programming**, **cybersecurity**, and **the intersection between technology and digital identity**.  
I’m driven by curiosity about how computers, networks, and people interact in the wired world.
